Upcoming Features
=================
[Click to return to Pipes](README.md)

This is a list of features that might be added to pipes in future.
If you have a suggestion or need something specific, please email michael.bradley@hotmail.co.uk. Thanks!

* Generalised versions of the pipes (n inlets / m outlets).
* Repeater pipe that repeats a message n times.
* Filter pipe to automatically "swallow" certain messages.
* **Send Or Receive Pipe**
  * Built with the existing pipes, this will allow you to send or receive from "n" inlets and "m" outlets. One outlet and one inlet will come first, but the generalised version will be a trivial extension.
